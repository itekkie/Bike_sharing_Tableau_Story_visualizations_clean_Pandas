## `Overview of the Bikesharing Analysis`	
	
The purpose for the bikesharing analysis is to create a story in Tableau and write a report that describes the key outcomes of the NYC Citibike analysis with a set of visualizations:
  - The length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
  - The number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week.
  - The number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

The tasks of the Challenge are:
  1. Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format.
  2. Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis that show:
  - How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
  - How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders.
  - A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender
  3. Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation
## `Resources`	

The analysis is created using next software: Python 3.8.8, Pandas 1.2.4, Jupyter-notebook 6.3.0, Tableau Public 2021.3.	
## `Bikesharing Analysis Result`	
### `- The cleaning data for the NYC Citibike analysis`	

To use datetime data correctly it needs to convert the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype by Pandas. The result of that can be found in the [Bikesharing_Challenge](./NYC_Citibike_Challenge.ipynb) file.
